SLEK: Shish's Linux Enhancement Kit
 Mostly called that because I typoed "skel"

A bunch of personal config settings, feel free
to copy the idea / settings / install script

TL;DR:
  put your configs in dotfiles (without the dots)
  run ./install.sh

This will install all the dotfiles, and keep old
ones in a dated backups folder
